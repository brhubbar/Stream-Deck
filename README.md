# Stream-Deck

This is a remix of MisteR_ofcl's
[MisteRdeck](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4627779).
The goal is to make a more configurable streamdeck, allowing users to specify
a layout to build a custom deck.

This project is under development. 

# To Do

- [ ] Duplicate MisteR_ofcl's design in OpenSCAD.
    - Build in flexibility/extensibility
    - Emphasis on code readability
    - Build each component into a separate module
- [ ] Subdivide the lid into 'zones' to allow users to specify number of 
      buttons, faders, and knobs.
    - Resize accordingly
- [ ] Allow rearrangement of said zones.
